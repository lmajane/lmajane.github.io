       <p>Lindsay is a strategic marketing and communications professional dedicated to  results-driven marketing and customer engagement strategies, and building brands that connect with customers. </p>
       <p>With a background in print, direct, out-of-home and digital marketing tactics, Lindsay spent the last 3 years at <a href="http://www.forgeworldwide.com">FORGE Worldwide</a> managing teams in an agency setting to develop, implement, and evaluate successful multi-channel campaigns in the higher ed, healthcare, technology space.</p>
       <p>Prior to FORGE, and after a brief period spent at a large agency, Hill Holliday, Lindsay took what she'd learned about process best-practices and working with large clients and escaped to start her own company where she partnered with designers and developers to launch successful websites for small- and medium-sized businesses across the US.</p>
       <p>When Lindsay goes offline, which is rare, she races sailboats competitively and holds a few national titles in dinghies and keel boats. But, even when she's racing, she'll probably try to snap an <a href="http://instagram.com/p/dIQBnBPjCC/#">Instagram photo</a> or two.</p>
