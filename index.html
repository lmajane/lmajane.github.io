    <p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5344/10275847386_3777cd57c1.jpg" />
Lindsay is a strategic marketing and communications professional dedicated to overseeing all aspects of results-driven marketing strategies. With a background in a range of digital marketing tactics, Lindsay has managed teams in an agency setting to develop, implement, and evaluate successful multichannel campaigns in the higher ed, healthcare, technology, B2B and B2C space.
<br><br>
Lindsay is currently a student at Startup Institute Boston until late December 2013, and is excited to dive deeper into topics such as customer conversion tactics, SEO / SEM, and gathering actionable insights from sets of data, as she believes these areas of study will round out her skill set as a successful startup marketer.
<br><br>
As someone who thrives in an entrepreneurial environment, Lindsay's prior experience also includes founding and growing a Boston-based web development company where she partnered with designers and developers to launch successful websites and marketing materials for small to medium companies across the US.
 <br><br>
When Lindsay goes offline, which is rare, she races sailboats competitively. But, even when she's racing, she'll probably try to snap an <a href="http://instagram.com/p/dIQBnBPjCC/#">Instagram photo</a> or two.</p>
